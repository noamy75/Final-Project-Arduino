# Final Project - Line Follower Robot

The robot is composed of a RaspberryPi, an arduino, motors, wheels and several kinds of sensors.

The project consists of two programs: an arduino sketch that runs on the arduino controller and a python script that runs on the RaspberryPi.

**Video - Auto mode control:** Driving in auto mode, applying changes of speed and proportional gain (Kp) via sliders, examining effects on the line position plot and line sensors values bar chart.

**Video - basic operations:** The robot starts in manual mode and gets driven to the line. Then, the user switches to automatic mode which makes the robot calibrating and starting a ride following the black line on the ground. On the left there's a dynamic barchart showing the line sensors readings.
