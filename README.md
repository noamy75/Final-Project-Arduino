# Final Project - Arduino Robot

The robot is composed of a RaspberryPi (master), an arduino (slave), engines, wheels and several kinds of sensors.

The project consists of two programs: an arduino sketch that runs on the arduino controller and a python script that runs on the RaspberryPi.

**Video demonstration:** The robot starts in manual mode and gets driven to the line. Then, the user switches to automatic mode which makes the robot calibrating and starting a ride following the black line on the ground. On the left there's a dynamic barchart showing the line sensors readings.
